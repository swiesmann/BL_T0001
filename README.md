## BLELabs Tutorial #0001 - cross-platform port ##

The original tutorial (in German) is at the [BLELabs website](http://www.blelabs.com/blog/category/tutorials). My primary development platform is Linux. Instead of porting it to Linux I decided to make it cross platform. With great cross-platform libraries available like [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) it made no sense make a port to another single platform.

The tutorial follows Google's [C++ style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml).
